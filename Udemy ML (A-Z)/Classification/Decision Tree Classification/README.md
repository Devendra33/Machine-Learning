# Decision Tree Classifier : 
--> Decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed.
# PROS: 
--> Interpretability, no need for feature scaling,works on both linear / nonlinear problems

# CONS:
--> Poor results on too small datasets,
overfitting can easily occur
