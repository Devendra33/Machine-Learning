# Hierarchical clustering:
--> 2 approches, 1. algglomerative HC( bottom - up approch):
in this approach every single point is treated as a different cluster and two closest clusters combine until
they become a single cluster., the process memory is stored in dendrogram

# PROS:
--> The optimal number of clusters can be
obtained by the model itself, practical
 visualisation with the dendrogram
