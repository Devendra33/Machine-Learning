# practising the numpy basics!

import numpy as np

# creating 1D and 2D Arrays


# Dimention of array
       # 1
       # 2

     # tells the data type of array
     # tells the row x col
     # number of elements in the array (6)

# to change the shape of array
      # ROWS * COLS  = Number of elements in the array (MUST CONDITION)

# To convert N-Dimention array to 1D array
  

# min and max operation
    
    
    # axis 0 for column and 1 for row

# for mathematical operation
       # return matrix of square rooted elements 
       # standard deviation of all element in the matrix

# if we apply +,-,*,/ on numpy array(dimention must be same else error.) then it performs mathematical operations
